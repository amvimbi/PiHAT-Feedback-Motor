# PiHAT-Feedback-Motor
The  microHAT  is  designed  to  interface  with  and  drive  a  motor  with  an  accurate  positional feedback loop-circuit. 
It will be mounted on a Pi Zero which will provide the compute capacity to achieve the desired specifications. 
This configuration is ideal for electromechanical systems where  high  spatial  precision  is  needed.  By  interfacing 
it  with  the  Pi  parent  board,  a  vast assortment  of  functionalities  can  be  realized.  These  include  the  logging
and  storing  of performance metrics -in real-time-on a micro-SD, scaling up and or integration into a larger system through
the micro-USB port. The General-Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins will be configured in analogue, input or output mode to 
enable the sensorsand feedback modules to interact with the Pi which will -in response-initiate desired actions such as 
altering the torque and turning on indicator LEDs. All in all, with its high clock speed, the Pi Zero will allow for high 
response, low positional feedback latency operation. Use cases of the circuit include but are not limited to driving a high 
precision robotic arm used in surgery, an electronic steering system vehicle which require low latency and good feedback and
control for wind turbines to ensure that they get the highest wind incidence as this requires accurate position awareness.
